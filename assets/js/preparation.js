            "Avoid wearing jewelry and metal objects: Metal objects can interfere with the MRI and cause inaccurate results. Remove all metal objects before your MRI, including jewelry, piercings, and hair accessories.",
            "Wear comfortable clothing: Wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothing without any metal zippers, buttons, or snaps. You may also be given a hospital gown to wear during the scan.",
            "Discuss any concerns with your doctor: If you have any concerns about the MRI, such as claustrophobia, anxiety, or discomfort lying still for an extended period, talk to your healthcare. They may be able to offer solutions to make you more comfortable or offer alternative imaging methods.",
            "Be sure to arrive on time for your appointment, as being late may cause unnecessary stress and delay the scan."
