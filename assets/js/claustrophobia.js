            "MRI can be a stressful experience for some people, particularly those who suffer from claustrophobia or anxiety. Claustrophobia is the fear of enclosed or tight spaces, and some patients may feel anxious or uncomfortable in the narrow, enclosed space of an MRI scanner.",
            "There are several strategies that can help alleviate anxiety and claustrophobia during an MRI scan. Many MRI facilities offer open MRI scanners, which are less enclosed and may be a more comfortable option for patients with claustrophobia.",
            "Another strategy is to distract patients during the scan, such as by providing music,or audiobooks.",
            "It is important for patients to communicate with their healthcare providers about any concerns they may have about the MRI scan. Healthcare providers can provide support and guidance to help patients manage anxiety and claustrophobia during the procedure."
