            "MRI scans are generally not recommended for people with pacemakers unless the pacemaker is specifically designed to be MRI conditional.",
            "MRI conditional means that pacemaker has been designed and tested to be safe for use during MRI scans under certain conditions which must be met before scanning",
            "The strong magnetic fields involved in MRI can interfere with the function of a pacemaker or cause heating of the device which can ause serious health complications for the patient",
            "For this reason, If a person with a pacemaker needs an MRI scan, their doctor will evaluate the specific pacemaker and MRI machine being used and determine whether it is safe to proceed with the scan."

            "These are also known as Implantable Loop Recorders, and  are used to diagnose and monitor heart rhythm disorders such as arrhythmias over an extended period of time.",
            "Like pacemakers, MRI scans can pose a risk to the function of cardiac reveal devices. The strong magnetic fields of an MRI machine can interfere with the function of the device or cause heating of the device, which can potentially cause serious injuries.",
            "However, some cardiac reveal devices are designed and tested to be MRI conditional, which means they can be safely used during MRI scans under certain conditions. If a person with a cardiac reveal device needs an MRI scan, their doctor will evaluate the specific device and MRI machine being used and determine whether it is safe to proceed with the scan.",
            "In some cases, the person may need to have their cardiac reveal device reprogrammed before the scan, hence, it is important for people with implantable cardiac devices to inform their healthcare providers about their device before undergoing the MRI scan."

            "Brain implants such as deep brain stimulators, cochlear implants or neural prostheses, aneurysm clip, hydrocephalus shunts, can potentially interact with MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) machines and cause interference or damage to both the implant and the MRI equipment.",
            "For example, deep brain stimulators used for treating Parkinson's disease or epilepsy, may be considered MRI-conditionals under certain conditions. However, other types of implants, such as cochlear implants or neural prostheses, may not be compatible with MRI at all. Additionally, some implants may heat up during an MRI, which can cause tissue damage or other complications.",
            "Overall, the safety of brain implants during MRI depends on several factors, and it's important to discuss your specific situation with your healthcare provider and MRI Radiography."

            "Titanium implants are generally used for all joints replacements, as well as joint plates and screws. These implants are generally considered safe and effective for most patients, hence,  the presence of a titanium implant should not prevent a patient from undergoing an MRI, and the majority of patients with these implants can safely undergo the procedure.",
            " While titanium is not magnetic, it is still capable of producing artifacts or distortions in MRI images. This can make it more difficult for healthcare professionals to interpret the images and diagnose any underlying medical conditions.",
            "It's important for patients with titanium implants to inform their healthcare provider before undergoing an MRI. This will allow the provider to assess the risks and take any necessary steps to ensure the safety and accuracy of the imaging procedure."
