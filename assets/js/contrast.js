            "Magnetic Resonance Imaging - MRI contrast injection involves the use of a contrast agent to enhance the visibility of certain tissues and blood vessels during an MRI scan.",
            "The most commonly used contrast agents for MRI scans contain a substance called Gadolinium. Gadolinium contrast agents are generally safe and well-tolerated by patients, but there are some risks associated with their use, particularly in people with kidney problems.",
            "During the MRI scan, the contrast agent travels through the bloodstream and into the tissues being imaged. This helps to create a clearer and more detailed image of the area being examined. The contrast agent is eventually eliminated from the body through the kidneys.",
            "The decision to use contrast injection during an MRI scan is usually made by a radiologist or a referring physician based on the patient's medical history and the specific imaging needs."
